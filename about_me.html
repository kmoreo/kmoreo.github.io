	<h1><u>Some Random Information About Myself</u></h1>
	<p>My name is Kristen, and this is a page with fun facts about myself. I graduated from UNC-Charlotte several years ago and I have been working as an Intellectual Property Paralegal since moving to Chicago 8 years ago. I really hope Dev Bootcamp can help me transition to something new!</p>

	<p><em>The basics:</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li>I live in Chicago.</li>
		<li>I like ice cream more than I like vegetables.</li>
		<li>I love dinosaurs!</li>
		<li>I know how to knit, but pretty much only scarves.</li>
	</ul>
