		<p>This site is filled with "amazingly interesting stuff." Seriously though, it's mostly information about my furry companions, some random facts about myself, and things I like.</p>

		<p>Since my website doesn't really have a cohesive theme, I Googled "cats and ice cream" and came across <a href="http://www.catster.com/lifestyle/cat-health-human-food-not-safe-ask-a-vet">this site</a> that covers the topic of kitties eating ice cream (among other things). There is a LOT of stuff in the source code that I don't understand, but I think I was able to identify the elements that create the social media buttons. There are also a bunch of "script" tags that I think relate to the options under the various menus across the top. I hope that I'll be able to understand this site's source code a bit more in a few weeks.</p>
